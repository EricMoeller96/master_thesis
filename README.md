This script includes optical remote sensing data from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 series of satellites, as well as the two Modis sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites.

With the script, selected data sets can be downloaded for further processing in GIS programs. Five indices (NDVI, NBR, NDWI, NDSI, LST) and derived differenced indices are represented in the script. The statistical metrics, with which the respective image collections are reduced, currently include: Median, Mean, Minimum, Maximum, Standard Deviation, Number of Observations.
